## About

The official App for your daily dining.
The App tries to automate a lot of the processes associated with your expeirence at Messes with a one-click solution in the App.
We take a look at a few of the features. But before that we talk about setup.

To start using this app, you'll have to activate your account. Once you've downloaded the app and installed it, go to the Reset Password Page
and enter your Roll Number to request a password reset link. A link for one time use only will be sent to your webmail inbox, and you can use
it to set your password. Please note that this is not the same as your webmail password.

## Token Generation

For every meal you eat, you will generate a unique QR Code that can be used as a token and availed once at the mess. The Mess Manager will scan
the QR on the Manager App, and you can proceed to dining. The QR is the only document you need. I-Cards and Mess Cards are not necessary.

## Saving Tokens
This is the one offline feature of this app. You can save generated token in your app, and load them directly without contacting our servers
